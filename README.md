#  A LaTeX Presentation Skeleton

The bare bones of a LaTeX presentation.

This repo is based largely on the [LaTeX_Boilerplate](https://github.com/gaara42/LaTeX_Boilerplate) by [Gaara42](https://github.com/gaara42). I used Gaara's work ages ago (two years in fact), and I am only now putting my version on github. I highly recommend checking [LaTeX_Boilerplate](https://github.com/gaara42/LaTeX_Boilerplate) out.
